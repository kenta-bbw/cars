# cars

The purpose of this project is to create a Java program that simulates a car dealership by creating objects that represent cars. The program will use object-oriented programming principles to define a Car class, which will have attributes such as the make and model, year, price, engine type, and fuel efficiency.

The program will allow users to create and manipulate Car objects, such as changing the make and model, adjusting the price, or calculating the fuel efficiency. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to interact with the Car objects and see the changes they make in real-time.

To add further depth to the project, the program could incorporate features such as a database to store information about the cars, a GUI to display the cars graphically, or the ability to generate reports about the cars based on their attributes.

This project will provide a great opportunity for users to practice object-oriented programming principles in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, the project will require users to think critically about the design of the Car class and how it should interact with other parts of the program.

By the end of this project, users should have a better understanding of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as experience in designing and implementing a class that represents a real-world object. They will also have a better understanding of how cars work and the factors that affect their performance, such as engine type and fuel efficiency.
